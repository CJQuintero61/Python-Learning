# This shell script is an example to show how
# docker containers can run a shell script on
# any device even if they don't normally support 
# shell. For example, Windows can't run shell
# scripts, but things like docker or WSL can 
# work around this issue. The container can
# instead run the shell script without Windows
# throwing an error for a shell script.
