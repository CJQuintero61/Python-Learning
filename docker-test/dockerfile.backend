# this is a simple dockerfile to demonstrate how to create
# a docker container for a python project and run the container

# to run:
#   docker compose up --build -d

# start with a base image
# here, we use the official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3

# set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# copy the requirements file from the root directory
# into the container
COPY requirements.txt ./

# create a virtual environment and install the dependencies
# inside the container
RUN python3 -m venv ./venv

# activate the virtual environment
RUN /bin/bash -c "source ./venv/bin/activate"

# install the dependencies from the requirements file
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy the source code of the project into the container
COPY . .
